In today's digital landscape, cybersecurity is of paramount importance to organizations across all industries. As part of our Capstone Project at The Knowledge House, our team embarked on a journey to develop a comprehensive cybersecurity training range. We aimed to provide hands-on experience in offensive and defensive security, Linux network operations, monitoring analysis, and the implementation of Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) systems. Leveraging the powerful capabilities of Amazon Web Services (AWS), we created a dynamic and immersive learning environment that enabled us to grow and develop essential cybersecurity skills.

### Empowering Learners: Developing Essential Skills through Offensive and Defensive Security Techniques
The increasing frequency and complexity of cyber threats necessitate the continuous development of cybersecurity expertise. Our Capstone Project aimed to bridge the skills gap by designing a training range that would simulate real-world scenarios and enable participants to learn and apply cybersecurity concepts effectively. Through a combination of offensive and defensive security techniques, Linux network operations, monitoring analysis, and SIEM implementation, we sought to equip learners with the necessary skills to protect critical systems and data.

## Offensive Security
To develop a holistic understanding of cybersecurity, we delved into offensive security practices. Ethical hacking and penetration testing methodologies allowed us to identify vulnerabilities in systems, networks, and applications. By emulating real-world attacks and exploiting potential weaknesses, we gained valuable insights into the mindset and techniques employed by malicious actors. Armed with this knowledge, we devised strategies to strengthen the defensive posture of our simulated environments.

Splunk is a leading SIEM (security information and event management) solution that collects, analyzes, and correlates network and machine logs in real time. 
Splunk is one of the most popular SIEM tool, but it is not the only one. There are a number of other SIEM tools available, and each has its own strengths and weaknesses.

### Here are the list of the most popular SIEM tools (Enterprise and Open Source): 

| Enterprise SIEM Tools  | Open Source SIEM Tools |
| ------------- | -------------- |
| Splunk Enterprise Security  | 	AlienVault OSSIM  |
| IBM QRadar  | ELK Stack  |
| Micro Focus ArcSight  | 	OSSEC  |
| LogRhythm NextGen SIEM Platform  | Wazuh  |
