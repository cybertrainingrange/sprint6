Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) and bastion hosts are essential components in the configuration of secure and cost-effective cloud environments, specifically in Amazon Web Services (AWS). This summary outlines the lessons designed for students to understand the concept of AWS, the importance of VPC and bastion host, and the process of creating a secure and cost-effective VPC and bastion host.

A VPC in AWS is an isolated cloud network where users can launch their resources in a virtual network that they define (Amazon Web Services, 2020). It gives control over the virtual networking environment, such as the selection of the IP address range, creation of subnets, and configuration of route tables and network gateways. Additionally, the concept of a bastion host is introduced. A bastion host is a special-purpose computer on a network, specifically configured to withstand attacks. It acts as a gatekeeper, allowing external devices to access resources within a private network in a controlled manner (Spafford, 1991).  The configuration of a VPC with a bastion host enhances security and cost-effectiveness. A VPC allows a secure and isolated environment to run AWS resources, offering enhanced privacy and control over the IP address range, subnet creation, and routing tables. A bastion host fortifies this security by acting as a gatekeeper and only granting necessary access, thus defending the network against unauthorized access.

The cost-effectiveness of a VPC comes from the selection of the right services based on service availability, security requirements, and budget constraints. Similarly, creating a secure bastion host in AWS is done by launching an EC2 instance with a lightweight Linux-based Amazon Machine Image (AMI) and the 't2.micro' instance type for cost-effectiveness. Configuring instance details, storage, tags, and a security group with minimal access points contribute to the security of the bastion host.  Learning to create a cost-effective and secure VPC and bastion host is crucial for cybersecurity students. It equips them with hands-on skills in designing and implementing secure cloud-based solutions, which is a highly sought-after competency in today's IT job market. Additionally, understanding the trade-offs between cost, performance, and security is vital to designing robust systems without incurring unnecessary expenses.  Understanding AWS, VPC, and bastion hosts, along with the ability to create a secure and cost-effective VPC and bastion host, is a valuable skill set for students to learn in a cybersecurity training range.
